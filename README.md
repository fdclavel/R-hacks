*This repository features scripts that include tips and techniques for enhancing workflow in R.* Script tasks include:

- Using R to manage, copy, and paste local files 
- Using R to extract zip files and import/export content.
- Using for loops
- Using the maps family of functions to loop more efficiently
- How to use the rvest package to scrape valuable data from websites
- Download files with R
- Use R to schedule repetitive task such as scraping at a set frequency
- APIs with R
- Get data with an API using R

These techniques can make data analysis and manangement much easier in some contexts (e.g., conducting operations across hundreds or thousands of small, related data sets; periodically pulling public information from websites and aggregating info into data sets that can be exported to other formats). Feel free to read through the scripts and tinker around with their capabilities to improve your R workflow.
